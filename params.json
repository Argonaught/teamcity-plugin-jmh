It specify path to the jar compiled for the benchmarks running.\r\nAlso you can configure benchmarks run with additional parameter supported by JMH, all of them available on build step settings page.\r\n\r\n### Viewing Results\r\nAfter the project build finished successfully, you can open *Benchmarks* tab on project build page. \r\nYou will see results grouped by benchmark mode and class name. Each bar shows result percentiles. \r\nBlack vertical line shows average value and gray dashed vertical line, closest previous build average result for this benchmark. \r\nThe bar can lighted with one of the colors: red and green. Red color means benchmark result became slower and green - faster.\r\n\r\n![](http://www.presidentio.com/img/portfolio/teamcity-jmh-plugin.png)\r\n\r\nLicensing\r\n=========\r\n\r\n[![][license img]][license]\r\n\r\nThis software is licensed under the terms in the file named \"LICENSE\" in this directory.\r\n\r\n\r\n[license]:LICENSE\r\n[license img]:https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-brightgreen.svg\r\n","google":"UA-64112096-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
